# Pop-Up Modal Project

This project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based pop-up modal that you can use on your website. It allows you to display a modal window when a button is clicked and close it using a close button.

- The modal is animated and appears from the top with a fade-in effect.

3. Create a button with the `id` "pop-btn" to trigger the modal.
4. Create a container with the class "modal-container" to house your modal content.
